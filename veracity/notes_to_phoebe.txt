notes for Phoebe
index.jade is the homepage, put all code inside the block called “content”
all the jade files in the partials folder extend index, so do the same as for index.jade, it will just replace the code in index.jade
the “include”s in layout.jade are head, header, footer, and jsdefaults
head.jade is for meta tags and stylesheets, basically the head part of the html file
header.jade and footer.jade are self explanatory
jsdefaults.jade is for the javascript files
put the packages we’re importing first, always starting with jquery and bootstrap. put any local javascript files last.

to test your stuff, open the terminal
change directory to the veracity folder. you’ll get used to the path, but for now alternate between “cd <foldername>” and “ls” until you’re in the right place
type “node app” and hit enter, if it says anything other than “listening on port 3000”, there’s a problem

git
i know we have sourcetree, which you’ve used a little, but i find doing git in the command line to be faster. here are the basic commands and what they do
git pull					obvious
git push					also obvious, but you should always do a pull before a push, it won’t let you push if there are things you haven’t pulled
git status					shows you what files have been changed, which are ready to commit, and which are untracked
git checkout .				unstage all files from being ready to commit
git checkout <filename>		unstage specific file from being ready to commit
git add .					stage all files as ready to commit
git add <filename>			stage specific file as ready to commit
git commit -a -m “<message>”	write a commit. -a includes all the files, and -m includes the message, and both are necessary
git log					shows you the commit log, but you can just look at sourcetree for that
